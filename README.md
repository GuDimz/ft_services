# ft_services.

## Introduction.

Ft_services will introduce you to Kubernetes. You will discover cluster management and deployment with Kubernetes. You will virtualize a network and do "clustering".

## Instructions.

* You must place all the necessary files for the configuration of your server in a folder called `srcs`.
* Your `setup.sh` file should be at the root of your repository. This script will setup all your applications.
* This subject requires both old and new practices. We therefore advise you not to be afraid to read a lot of documentation about Docker, Kubernetes, and all other things useful for the project.

## How to use?

`./setup.sh`

## Good Luck!
